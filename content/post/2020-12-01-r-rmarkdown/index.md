My name is Maellin Joy Dineros and I welcome to my personal website!

About me:
 
I am currently a senior student at California State University - Channel Islands, majoring in Mathematics with a Statistics Emphasis and minoring in Computer Science. One day, I hope to work as a Data Scientist specifically towards the improvement of nature and wildlife.
 
Fun facts about me: 
 
-I can finish reading 1 book per day.
 
Some time around 2016, I stopped reading books for fun. 6 years later, I picked up an interesting book and never looked back. 30 days later, I finished 28 more books within the same month. Here is a photo of my favorite book out of the 28!

-I have 2 cats and 2 dogs!
 
My dogs are both female Maltese Poodles. One is a six-year-old, named Potchi, and the other eight-year-old, named Mikmik. Mikmik has a full-on obsession with her mom (me) and she cannot rest if I am out of her sight! Potchi, on the other hand, is absolutely loyal to no one. She would be happily greet a home intruder.

My cats are both male gray cats (one being a solid gray color, and the other having a tuxedo pattern) and they came from the same litter! They are now 7 months old, and are the sweetest little kitties I have ever met! Here they are!
